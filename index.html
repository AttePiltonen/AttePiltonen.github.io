				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<!--p>I am a physicist-turned-data scientist, currently working on using Python and Machine Learning in geospatial intelligence contexts and maritime domain awareness.</p-->
<!-- 				<p>My background is in theoretical physics; I graduated with my Master's degree from the University of Oxford in 2022, with specilizations in Astrophysics and Quantum Field Theory. Since my Master's Thesis, my research at Oxford has focused on statistical understanding of the dynamics and structure of the star system ß Lyrae using using high-quality spectroscopic data from the Global Jet Watch observatories. </p>
				<p>Quantum Computing is one of my greatest research interests. My extensive experience in the field includes development of numerical models for the quantum phase behavior and dynamics of superconducting qubits using Python, as well as creating algorithms for optimizing self-correcting quantum logic states.</p>
 -->			<p>As a physicist-turned-data scientist, I bring a unique perspective to my current work, which focuses on 
	leveraging Python and Machine Learning to address challenges in geospatial intelligence and maritime domain awareness. 
	I use my expertise in data analysis and modeling to extract insights from complex datasets and develop predictive models 
	that support decision-making in these areas.</p>
 				<p>I hold a Master's degree in Physics from the University of Oxford, with specializations in Theoretical Astrophysics 
					and Quantum Field Theory. Since completing my Master's Thesis, I have conducted research as part of the <a class="link" href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/astrophysics">Astrophysics Department</a> at Oxford that centers 
					on statistical analyses of the dynamics and structure of the ß Lyrae star system. To this end, I have leveraged 
					high-quality spectroscopic data from our <a class="link" href="https://www.globaljetwatch.net/">Global Jet Watch</a> observatories.
			    </p>
				<p>My research interests also extend to the field of Quantum Computing, in which I have amassed extensive experience through my work with the <a class="link" 
href="https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/nano-and-molecular-systems-research-unit">Nano and Molecular Systems Research Unit</a> at the University of Oulu. 
					Specifically, I have developed numerical models for analyzing the quantum phase behavior and dynamics of 
					superconducting qubits using Python. Additionally, I have designed algorithms to optimize self-correcting quantum 
					logic states.
