 -->			<p>As a physicist-turned-data scientist, I bring a unique perspective to my current work, which focuses on leveraging Python and Machine Learning to address challenges in geospatial intelligence and maritime domain awareness. I use my expertise in data analysis and modeling to extract insights from complex datasets and develop predictive models that support decision-making in these areas. Originally from Oulu, Finland 🇫🇮, I am currently based in Orlando, Florida ☀️🇺🇸.</p>
 				<p>I hold a Master's degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Oxford, with specializations in Astrophysics 
					and Quantum Field Theory. Since completing my Master's Thesis, I have conducted research as part of the <a class="link" href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/astrophysics">Astrophysics Department</a> at Oxford that centers 
					on statistical analyses of the dynamics and structure of the ß Lyrae star system. To this end, I have leveraged 
					high-quality spectroscopic data from our <a class="link" href="https://www.globaljetwatch.net/">Global Jet Watch</a> observatories.
			    </p>
				<p>My research interests also extend to the field of Quantum Computing, in which I have amassed extensive experience through my work with the <a class="link" 
href="https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/nano-and-molecular-systems-research-unit">Nano and Molecular Systems Research Unit</a> at the University of Oulu. 
					Specifically, I have developed numerical models for analyzing the quantum phase behavior and dynamics of 
					superconducting qubits using Python. Additionally, I have designed algorithms to optimize self-correcting quantum 
					logic states.
